// Exercise 2: Set It Up
	// write a class component
	// make it a form element with class name ImageUploaderForm
	// write one input element and button element inside
	// export default the component!


// Exercise 5: Get InFormation
// Rewrite this component to accept user input
// The goal: When the user inputs a url, the component should log it to the console
    // You might want to read a little bit more about forms here: https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html
    // but essentially, there are two parts to this:
    // 1) the input reflecting it's current value when the input changes
    // 2) and submitting the form.
    // For 1), you will need to create an handleChange function and pass it as a prop to the <input> element.
    // handleChange will set the state with the value of the target of the event passed to it.
    // For 2) you will need to create a handleSubmit function and pass it as an onClick prop to the button.
    // handleSubmit will be the one submitting - ie console.log the current url in the state for now.


// Exercise 5: BONUS
// Goal: make this form actually upload an image to the feed!
// When a user inputs a full image url, it should update the
// feed to include the image as a FeedItem!

    // All the data for the photos are located in HomePage -
    // so how do you get data from the user input of the ImageUploaderForm
    // to the HomePage component and update the photo data?
    // First of all the, photo data in HomePage will be updating (somehow, more on that later).  As such, if
    // data is going to change inside of a component, what should you put it in (hint: internal state!)

    // Then, how are you going to get the new photo url from ImageUploaderForm back to Homepage?
    // Pass in a function called handleAddPhoto from HomePage to ImageUploaderForm that
    // takes the url of the photo updates photos state with by creating a new object in the photos data.
    // Make sure that function is called on handleSubmit in ImageUploaderForm!

import React from 'react';

class ImageUploaderForm extends React.Component{
    state = {
        url:"",
    };
    handleSubmit = (event) =>

        event.preventDefault();
        this.props.uploadPhoto(this.state.url)

        this.setState({ url: event.target.value });
      };
    render(){
        return(
            <form className="ImageUploaderForm" onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <input
